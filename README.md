## Why did I choose IMDb dataset for my demonstration of exploratory data analysis?

I chose "IMDb Movie Reviews" dataset, because it is well suited for EDA. This dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews for natural language processing or sentiment analysis tasks, and it is split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. The IMDb dataset is a good choice for EDA, because it offers:
- A large number of text-based samples to work with.
- A binary classification problem (positive or negative sentiment), making it easier to visualize and understand the results.
- Real-world, user-generated content that can present various challenges in preprocessing and feature extraction, such as noise, spelling errors, and informal language.
- The opportunity to explore a variety of text processing techniques, feature extraction, and data visualization methods.

## Note

EDA was implemented in jupyter notebook, therefore you will need to execute individual code blocks to replicate the results. Notebook is well documented and is broken down into sections, so it should be a straight forward process.

## Instructions
- Jupyter notebook will attempt to pip install a few libraries, so make sure that you are in correct python or conda environment.
- Clone the repo
- Open the notebook either in Visual Studio Code or in the jupyter notebook
- Make sure that correct python interpreter in the correct environment is selected.
- If you want to replicate the results, run each code block, starting from the top.
